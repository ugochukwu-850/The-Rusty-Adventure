# Problem Set 1: Noir Clone Powered by RUST AND ZOLA
-----

### In this problem set we would be building a noir clone to resize images and convert them to black and white. Using the RUST programming langauge for data processing and the zola framework for templating.


## Usage
- In the folder raw images input all your image files
- And run 
```sh
./zola_serve
```


## Step 1: Getting Started
- Init a  new zola app
- Create your README.md files for this project 
- Understand the directory structure of zola apps and how to create simple pages in it
- Create a simple template and design it with your favourite tools

## Step 2: Creating a gallery mode using zola's inbuilt tools
- Using zolas inbuilt tools create a gallery view mode
- Intergrate zolas inbuilt resize functionality in the gallery view
- Understanding how to loop through section contents would be a big leap
- Sync with page directions
- Create the RUST functions to process the images
- Test function and confirm ready to intergrate
- __Deadline__: **21/06/23**


## Step 3: Testing, Intergration and Submittion
- Intergrate your fine tuned function into your gallery view 
- Carry out various test to confirm your app now fufils the requirement
- Fine tune and style 
- Using git submit you work to the repo
